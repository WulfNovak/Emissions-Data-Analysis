# Data Analysis on World Emissions Data

Project Notes: 
* Interactive Maps can be seen here: https://wulfnovak.github.io/
* For the time being, plots from the emissions_eda script are provided in the 'Plots' folder
* Categorized development indicators are made available in the 'Data' folder
  * (These may not be used in further analysis due to NAs)

The following is underway:
* Determining if any development indicators can be used despite lack of coverage
* Testing the following clustering algotherithms to partition countries to
  rising and declining emissions categories.
  (GBTM), growth mixture modeling (GMM), and longitudinal k-means (KML)
* Generalized Linear Mixed Model Study and experimentation.
